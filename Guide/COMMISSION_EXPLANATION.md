# Commission-Based Work Explanation

## How Commission Works

### When a Reseller Invites a Consumer:
When a reseller invites a consumer to the platform, the reseller earns a commission on every purchase made by that consumer. The commission is calculated as a percentage of the invoice amount, using either:
- The reseller's custom commission rate (if set), or
- The default commission rate (typically 10%)

**Example:** If a consumer purchases a $100 product and the reseller has a 10% commission rate, the reseller earns $10.

### When a Reseller Invites Another Reseller:
When a reseller invites another reseller, the referring reseller can potentially earn commissions from:
- The sales made by consumers referred by the new reseller (downline commissions)
- Any additional commission structure based on the new reseller's performance

This creates a multi-level commission structure where resellers can build their network and earn from both direct consumer sales and their sub-resellers' activities.

**Key Points:**
- Resellers earn commissions on their direct consumer referrals
- Resellers can expand their earning potential by building a network of sub-resellers
- Commission rates can be customized per reseller or use the platform default
- All commissions are tracked and calculated automatically on each transaction
