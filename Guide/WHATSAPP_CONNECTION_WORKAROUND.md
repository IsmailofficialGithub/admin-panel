# WhatsApp Connection Issue - Temporary Workaround

## Problem
The WhatsApp socket connection is unstable and keeps closing/reopening. This causes message sending to fail with "Connection Closed" error.

## Root Cause
The Baileys socket is not maintaining a stable connection. It connects, then closes, then auto-reconnects in a loop.

## Temporary Solution

**IMPORTANT: You need to manually reconnect the application before sending messages.**

### Steps to Send a Message Successfully:

1. **Go to Admin Settings → WhatsApp tab**

2. **Disconnect the application:**
   - Click the red "Disconnect" button on your connected application
   - Wait for status to change to "Disconnected"

3. **Reconnect the application:**
   - Click the green "Connect" button
   - Scan the QR code again
   - Wait for status to show "Connected" (green badge)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Wait an additional 10-15 seconds after it shows "Connected"

4. **Send your message:**
   - Go to the Message Sandbox
   - Select the application
   - Enter phone number and message
   - Click "Send Message"
   - ✅ Should work now!

## Why This Happens

The socket connection is closing immediately after the auto-reconnect completes. This is likely because:
- The session data might be corrupted
- The auto-reconnect doesn't fully establish the connection
- There might be a timing issue with Baileys

## Permanent Fix (Recommended)

The best solution is to **use file-based auth state** instead of database storage for now. This is more stable with Baileys.

However, for your current setup, the workaround above should work.

## Alternative: Wait Longer

If you don't want to reconnect manually:
1. After the application shows "Connected"
2. **Wait 30 seconds** before trying to send a message
3. This gives the connection time to stabilize

## Testing

Try this exact sequence:
```
1. Disconnect application (if connected)
2. Connect application
3. Scan QR code
4. Wait for "Connected" status
5. Wait additional 15 seconds
6. Try sending message
7. ✅ Should work!
```

## Long-term Solution

Consider switching to file-based session storage (using `useMultiFileAuthState` from Baileys) which is more stable than database storage for WhatsApp connections.

**For now, use the manual reconnect workaround above to send messages successfully.**
