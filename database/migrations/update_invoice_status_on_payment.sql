-- Update invoice status logic:
-- When a payment is submitted, invoice status should change to 'under_review'
-- Invoice becomes 'paid' only when payment is approved by admin

-- Note: This is handled in the backend code, but we can add a trigger as backup
-- The backend should set invoice status to 'under_review' when payment is submitted

-- Create or replace function to update invoice status on payment submission
