-- Migration: Verify Realtime setup for Genie tables (RLS is disabled)
-- Description: Since RLS is disabled, we just need to ensure Realtime is properly configured

-- Step 1: Verify tables are in the publication
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename 
FROM pg_publication_tables 
WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime' 
AND tablename IN ('call_logs', 'genie_scheduled_calls', 'genie_leads');

-- Step 2: Check if RLS is enabled (should be false for all tables)
SELECT 
  tablename, 
  rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('call_logs', 'genie_scheduled_calls', 'genie_leads');

-- Step 2: Check existing policies
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  policyname, 
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('call_logs', 'genie_scheduled_calls', 'genie_leads')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Step 3: If RLS is enabled, ensure there are SELECT policies for authenticated users
-- For call_logs
