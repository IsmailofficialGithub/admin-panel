CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS outbound;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS inbound;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS billing;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS admin;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS analytics;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS future_features; -- For tables not needed yet

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA inbound TO authenticated, anon, service_role;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA billing TO authenticated, anon, service_role;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA admin TO authenticated, anon, service_role;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA analytics TO authenticated, anon, service_role;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA future_features TO authenticated, anon, service_role;

GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA outbound TO service_role;
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA inbound TO service_role;
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA billing TO service_role;
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA admin TO service_role;
